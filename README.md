## Hello ${name}, welcome to my profile! ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm a passionate Software Engineer and a former systems analyst.

### What do I work with ?

Today, i'm working with Web Development, using **Node.js** and **React**, mostly with **TypeScript**.

Both **MySQL** and **MongoDB** databases are friends of mine ( Even though I love MongoDB a bit more haha ðŸ’š ).

As I work in a **microservices** environment, I'm very familiar with messaging ( I use **RabbitMQ** ).

### What I am studying ?

I'm venturing into **Golang** and working on to become a better **Software Architect**

### What is the most important thing to me ?

People. People come before Code or anything else.

If I do impact someone's life in a positive way, my mission is done.

I alwas try to treat people with respect and kindness, no matter what is their position on a company or society.

### Where can you find me?

Easy, here's my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julio-mendes/).

Or if you prefer, mail me: **mendes_jc@outlook.com**.

### Fun facts

- I love programming, but my heart is divided between code and music ðŸŽµ. It's easy to find me playing some instrument and singing.
- I started my journey on the Software Development world with **Games** ðŸŽ®. Everything started when I discovered, many years ago, that it was possible to play GTA San Andreas online and better, I could create my own server!
  After that, i dived into programming ( knowing NOTHING ) and started my knowlege journey, on the very beginning with **Pawn** language (used in GTA SA-MP servers), going through **Unity3D** to develop my own games ( it was simple games, but it was AWESOME to do! ) and finally coming to the Web universe.
