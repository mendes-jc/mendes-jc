## Hello ${name}, welcome to my profile! ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm a passionate Game Engineer, but I have experience working as a Full-Stack Developer and also as a Systems Analyst.

### What is the most important thing to me?

People. People come before Code or anything else.

My mission is to have a positive impact on people's lifes. Today, I like to achieve that thourgh the games I work with.

### Where can you find me?

Easy, here's my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julio-mendes/).

Or if you prefer, mail me: **mendes_jc@outlook.com**.

### Fun facts

- I love programming, but my heart is divided between code and music ðŸŽµ. It's easy to find me playing some instrument and singing.
- I started my journey on the Software Development world with **Games** ðŸŽ®. Everything started when I discovered, many years ago, that it was possible to play GTA San Andreas online and better, I could create my own server!
  After that, i dived into programming ( knowing NOTHING ) and started my knowlege journey, on the very beginning with **Pawn** language (used in GTA SA-MP servers), going through **Unity3D** to develop my own games ( it was simple games, but it was AWESOME to do! ) and finally coming to the Web universe.
